Comment text: ngl, online friends can be awesome, especially if you click with people who get you in ways irl friends might not. but it can also feel kinda distant sometimes if you never meet them face to face. worth it if you vibe, but you gotta be careful who you trust

Comment text: tbh, there are a few big reasons. like, if they‚Äôre super toxic and always bring you down, or if they don‚Äôt respect your boundaries. also, if they‚Äôre constantly lying or just not a good vibe anymore, it‚Äôs time to bounce. life‚Äôs too short for that negativity

Comment text: You get to a certain age (or at least I did) and you start to realize which of your relationships are one-sided (you put all the effort in and you get zero effort back).

Comment text: So I have a trick for this, learnt from years in a customer facing service role. When you take the step back, leave one foot where it is to act as a kind of physical barrier. When they try to take a step forward, their foot will bump yours and it usually gets them to stay where they are. Doesn't work 100% of the time but it's better than the weird backing away that will happen otherwise

Comment text: You're certainly no more of an AH than men who do the same thing. You're not wrong for granting his wish for a divorce. And you're not wrong for not letting him be single and free of responsibility. You both brought this child into the world so you both are responsible for her 50/50. What exactly that responsibility looks like will be determined by the courts. But in reality, neither one of you deserve this child that you're both fighting to get rid of. Hopefully an arrangement works out where at least someone loves this child the way that she deserves to be loved.

Comment text: My friend just got divorced. Her husband asked for literally no custody. Zero. He wants to be able to see the kids at weekends/when he feels like it but not for them to stay with him or to take any custodial responsibility. He's also all about the many ways he feels my friend should be doing a better job as a parent and frequently accuses her of alienating him from the kids he doesn't want living with him.

Comment text: This is not true, my ex kept calling CPS on me frequently just because she didn't want me to have any custody or rights to see our child. She called so many times they were getting tired of the blatant lies. The worst was once she said I tied her to a chair, cut her face and torture the child. The police got involved in that one, saw there was no evidence of bruising on her and no cut on her face. When our kid was questioned they kept saying no to everything about abuse. CPS and the police were pissed off for the false allegation and warned her. So she called anonymously going forward. Then she took me to court multiple times and tried to use that CPS kept coming to my house because I was always under investigation for abuse. I showed the judge the letters that showed I was cleared of everything, no abuse or neglect was ever founded. I told the judge that she is the one who is wasting resources and time of everyone by constantly calling CPS on me as she believes if they get called enough I would lose my custody. She asked the judge for full custody and no contact for me. The judge yelled at her and threw the case out.

Comment text: That sounds rough, and it's crazy how far she went with the false accusations just to keep you from having any rights. The fact that she made such wild claims and even involved the police shows how extreme it got. It‚Äôs good that CPS and the police saw through it and that the judge called her out for wasting everyone‚Äôs time. Using those reports in court backfired on her, and it‚Äôs great that the judge saw the truth and threw out the case. Sounds like a stressful situation, but at least the system worked in your favor in the end.

Comment text: Just because it didn't happen for you didn't mean it's not true. My nephew is young, naive and clumsy. When he was 6, I gave him a shower when the water suddenly turned boiling hot. He ended up with a pretty bad burn on his forehead and CPS got called. After that case was closed and he healed up, he then decided that he was Spiderman and tried to climb down from the top of a bunk bed head first. He fell off the bed, landed on a concrete floor and cracked his skull in two places. CPS came for a visit again and it was the same caseworker. She explained that his file would stay open for at least a year. Thankfully those were the only two bad accidents he's had so it's most likely closed by now.

Comment text: Sounds like it's past time for your parents, if they aren't going to throw him out, to make him start paying rent. Enough rent to cover what he's costing them. When he complains have them add up, as best they can, how much they've spent on him. Which will be much more than what they spent on you.

Comment text: Totally agree. It‚Äôs one thing to help your kids when they genuinely need it, but buying a third vacation home is a whole different story. Unequal financial treatment can definitely create resentment, though. Sitting down with the daughter and explaining the support given so far and future intentions might help ease tensions. But yeah, with your parents, if neither of you owns a home and they gave your brother one, that‚Äôs just straight up unfair. And of course, you‚Äôd likely be the one they lean on for help later on.

Comment text: Go to a food bank or a soup kitchen. Make that a part of your regular routine. Get on food stamps. Pregnancy is a dangerous time to restrict food, and you need to start figuring out how you're going to get enough food when you have another mouth to feed. Your wife and your child NEED more food. And so do you.

Comment text: WIC is an amazing resource. I wish people would stop vilifying food banks, food stamps, and WIC. Especially in this day and age where food is expensive for most of the population.

Comment text: Before she retired, my mother was a nutritionist working for Cooperative Extension, and her job was to go out to anyone who was receiving help from any of those programs who requested her (the service was 100% optional), and she'd teach them to cook with what they were getting. She still has people come up to her and introduce her to the kids they were expecting when she taught them to cook with the WIC foods. I wish every county had the same program available.

Comment text: They vilify it and then the same motherfuckers blame people who beg for 'not using it', as if food is the only need when homeless and shelters don't fill up. All to save themselves from the idea they might be vulnerable in that situation too.

Comment text: Don't forget that these same ppl also are the ones who fight at every turn against abortion. They don't want to help with your pregnancy, baby or kids through their taxes but they want to control a woman's reproductive rights. If mom and baby die off starvation during pregnancy BC mom could've access an abortion they're cool with it since it didn't cost them anything... JMO

Comment text: My mother, 5‚Äô7‚Äù 115lbs her whole life, used to say, ‚ÄúFood is glorious, enjoy it all, but never forget that there are eating foods, and there are tasting foods. As long as you never confuse the two, you will stay healthy and enjoy every delicious thing!‚Äù

Comment text: I say there's food and then there's treats or snacks. Food is nutritious and contains things we need usually and usually eat more of it compared to a snack or treat. Apple? Snack. Pasta with veg? Food. Lollipop? Treat. Very much annoys my 5 and 9 year old when they're complaining of being absolutely so hungry and they just really want to eat or buy lollipop/gum/gummy worms/ ice cream. Eating and tasting is good too but I'm pedantic with words, so I personally wouldn't use that one.

Comment text: Based off of your reasoning, an apple would be a food, not a snack. Apples have soluble and insoluble fiber, sugar, vitamins, minerals, etc. All things we need, now a caramel apple on the other hand, I would consider a treat.

Comment text: I did something similar to raise my child With a healthier relationship to food than I after being raised by a parent with an eating disorder. There's foods that our bodies need because they have the vitamins and nutrients we require to not only stay alive but be healthy. Then there's the foods we want because they taste good but they Don't make us healthy and sometimes they lead to not feeling good. It's okay to eat those foods, the important part is not overeating them and balancing them with the healthy foods our body does need. But in explaining to her that it leads to us not feeling good instead of being bad, I taught her how to connect with her body. She chose to eat less sugar because she noticed it gave her a headache. She self regulated based on connection to how food made her feel, not fear or control. Then I took it a step further and I did explain the difference between quality. Like processed food versus raw ingredients. Example-A McDonald's hamburger does not have the same nutritional value as a homemade hamburger. A store-bought box lasagna comes with a bunch of additives that are not in a made from scratch lasagna. Again, these foods are okay to eat, you just want to try to balance them with nutritious food and not only eat that. It's all about everything in moderation. I Fully understand that processed food has no value at all and is bad for us. But when you restrict something it just makes kids want to do it more. Or internalize that they are bad for eating those things. My mom fed me a ton of processed food but was very very strict on sweets and sugars. This just simply led to me stealing coins from her so that I could sneak to the gas station on my bike, which itself was dangerous, and I would gorge out on these things in extreme excess instead of having one after dinner. It led to lying, stealing, hiding and drove a wedge in our communication and relationship. Then because she was obsessed with weight but not health of the food, I thought because I was skinny I was healthy. I just happen to have a really weird metabolism and I cannot gain weight no matter what I eat. Only time I gain weight is when my hormones are off and then it happens really really fast and nothing I can do to lose the weight. My weight has never been good dependant. So for years I justified the way I ate because I wasn't gaining weight. But I was far from healthy, had nutritional deficiencies and health issues related to such. But there was also a lot of misinformation around nutrition when I was growing up. Like fat being bad and vegetable oils and seed oils being a healthy replacement. We ate margarine instead of butter. Only to find out the opposite is true. But this was fueled by fear and trauma as we had early amd repeated heart attacks and strokes in our family. My mother had watched her own father, have four heart attacks, open heart surgery, and then finally die of a stroke all before the age of 55. But Turns out it's something genetic and unrelated to diet. However, the diet of low-fat and processed food makes us even more unhealthy increasing the same risk we thought we were avoiding. So I go with moderation and balance.
